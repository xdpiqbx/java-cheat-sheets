# SOLID

## Single Responsibility Principle
a class should do one thing and therefore it should have only a single reason to change

## Open-Closed Principle
classes should be open for extension and closed to modification

## Liskov Substitution Principle
subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes

## Interface Segregation Principle
is about separating the interfaces

## Dependency Inversion Principle
classes should depend upon interfaces or abstract classes instead of concrete classes and functions

---
## Rule of three ("Three strikes and you refactor")

---
## KISS
Keep It Simple Stupid

---
## DRY
Don't Repeat Yourself

---
## AHA
Avoid Hasty Abstractions

---
## SSOT / SPOT

Single Source Of Truth / Single Point Of Truth

_every data element is mastered (or edited) in only one place_

---
## Composition Over Inheritance

objects with complex behaviors should contain instances of objects with individual behaviors

---
## Avoid Premature Optimization

---
## Law of Demeter (principle of least knowledge)

---
## Separation of Concerns (SoC)

is an abstract version of single responsibility. Program should be designed with different containers, which should not have access to each other. Each piece of code is completely independent.

---
## Inversion of Control (IoC)

enables a framework to take control of the flow of a program and make calls to our custom code.

---
## YAGNI

You Aren't Going to Need It

you should never code for functionality on the off chance that you may need something in the future (you shouldn't try to solve a problem that doesn't exist)

---
## Minimize coupling

---
## Document Your Code
